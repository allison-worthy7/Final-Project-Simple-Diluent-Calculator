# Final-Project-Simple-Diluent-Calculator
About the Simple Dilution Calculator:

This project is a simple dilution calculator that calculates the amount of diluent needed to achieve a desired final concentration from a stock solution of known concentration and volume. The calculator takes in user inputs for the initial concentration, volume, and units of the stock solution, as well as the desired final concentration. The program then converts the initial and final concentrations and volume units to the standard unit of mg/mL and mL, respectively, and uses the dilution formula c1v1=c2v2 to calculate the final volume and diluent volume. The project includes unit tests to ensure that the dilution calculator class is functioning correctly.

Included Features:

1: "Master loop" where user can repeatedly enter values for initial concentration, final concentration, intial volume and their units. User can also choose to exit the application.

2: Dictionary that is populated with several conversion factors that are later retrieved for the conversion tool.

3: Conversion Tool is used to convert all units of concentration and volume to mg/mL or mL.

Special Instructions:

This program is designed to convert units that are most commonly used in dilutions suchs as: ug, mg, g, uL, mL and L. Please keep this in mind when entering values for units of concentration or volume.

This program also assumes that the user's desired final concentration are in units of mg/mL, as this is the most commonly used unit of concentration for simple dilutions.
